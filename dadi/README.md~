# Pipeline to run dadi

Runs multiple population pairs / sfs versions, specified in config, and multiple model for each also specified in config file, together with search ranges for each parameter.

We used dadi models defined in https://github.com/dportik/dadi_pipeline; you can copy the scripts by

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dportik/dadi_pipeline/master/Two_Population_Pipeline/Models_2D.py
```

(It should also be possible to run the pipeline using your own models)
