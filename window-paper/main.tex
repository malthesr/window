\section{Code and data availability}

The human data analysed is part of the 1000 Genomes \cite{1000g2015} phase 3 low depth sequencing data.
Alignments have been made available by the 1000G project and can be accessed at \shorturl{ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase3/}.
The impala data has been made available via the SRA with accession \texttt{PRJNA862915}.
Analysis and plotting code, as well as the cleaned data corresponding to the final results, is available at \shorturl{github.com/malthesr/window} and the \winsfs software itself at \shorturl{github.com/malthesr/winsfs}.
